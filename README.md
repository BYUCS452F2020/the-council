[Meaning of Council](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/council-counsel/)

Submit your problem, question, decision, and let the Council decide your fate.

The identity of the councilmembers are hidden, yet their vast wisdom shall be on full display. Councilmembers may vote to bring on a new member, yet this occurence is rare and only happens in times of great necessity. Their discretion is guaranteed, unless you decide to share the great knowledge you have gained.
