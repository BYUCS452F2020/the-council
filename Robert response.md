I'd be interested in working on this project, if you're looking for another team member. I think it’s a cool idea that could provide real value to people.

**(Technical)** I'd be happy to help with frontend or backend. I've worked a lot with React the past couple years, and currently work with Node.js. I would be interested in gaining experience with Firebase, if that gets chosen as the NoSQL database.

**(Business)** The project proposal didn't explicitly mention business aspects, but I could see how this could be monetized, to compensate the council members.

**(Legal)** I'm curious what kind of legal responsibility (if any) the council members (or the app/organization) would have for people's decisions made after consulting the app. I imagine some waiver or clause in the terms of use would be able to mitigate this.
